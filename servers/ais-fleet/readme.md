# AIS Fleet MCP Server

The **AIS Fleet MCP Server** provides a unified interface for discovering, querying, and analyzing vessel activity from AIS data. It allows MCP-based agents and AI assistants to answer natural-language maritime questions such as “Show me cargo ships near the Panama Canal,” “Which tankers are in the Singapore Strait,” or “Find fishing vessels off the coast of San Diego.” By enabling advanced queries across vessel types, regions, and time ranges, it helps developers, researchers, and fleet operators build intelligent, location-aware marine applications and explore real-world vessel movements such as cruise ship departures from Seattle or seasonal fleet activity in Alaska.

## Features

- **Rich Vessel Queries** – Find vessels by location, type, size, or custom areas.  
- **Historical Analysis** – Examine traffic density, regional patterns, and port activity over time.  
- **Advanced Queries** – Detect canal transits, fishing zones, cargo routes, or coastal activity across any combination of filters.  
- **Extensible Design** – Serve as a data and intelligence layer for marine analytics, research, and AI applications.

## Example Use Cases

- Identify vessels that transited the Panama Canal in the past 24 hours.  
- Analyze fishing activity along the Alaskan coast during summer.  
- Track cargo traffic density through the Singapore Strait.  
- Build AI agents that respond to natural-language maritime queries.
