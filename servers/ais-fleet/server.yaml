    title: AIS Fleet
    description: The AIS Fleet MCP Server provides a unified interface for discovering, querying, and analyzing vessel activity from AIS data. It enables MCP-based agents and tools to answer complex maritime questions such as vessel movements between regions, port activity trends, or traffic patterns over time, empowering developers, researchers, and fleet operators to build intelligent, location-aware marine applications powered by AIS insights.
