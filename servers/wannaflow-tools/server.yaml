  title: WannaFlow Tools
  description: |
    Standalone MCP tools for AI-assisted development workflows. Optimized for token efficiency with zero external dependencies.

    **Tools included:**

    • **auto_test** - Automated testing and validation for TypeScript/JavaScript
      - Actions: run (jest/vitest/mocha), validate (type-check), full (lint + tests)
      - Auto-detects test framework
      - Returns structured results with file:line references

    • **project_memory** - Persistent context storage between sessions
      - Categories: decision, pattern, issue, context, preference
      - SQLite-based persistence (no external DB required)
      - Token savings: 30-50% by avoiding repetitive explanations

    • **cost_analyzer** - Token cost prediction and optimization
      - Actions: predict, compare, budget_check, optimize
      - Supports 19+ models (local, deepseek, gemini, claude, gpt-4)
      - All calculations local - no API required

    Perfect for developers who want to optimize their AI-assisted workflow costs and maintain context between sessions.
