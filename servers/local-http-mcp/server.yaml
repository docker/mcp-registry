  title: Local HTTP Bridge
  description: |
    Production-ready MCP server that bridges HTTP requests from Claude to your private network resources.
    Enables AI assistants to interact with internal APIs, localhost services, and custom DNS entries
    that are only accessible from the host machine. Features allowlist-based security to control
    which domains and endpoints can be accessed.
