REGISTRY SUBMISSION UPDATE - SIMPLECHECKLIST MCP SERVER v1.0.1
================================================================

Updated SimpleCheckList MCP Server to v1.0.1 with Docker stability fix:

üöÄ What's New:
- Fixed Docker container exit issue - now runs stable in containerized environments
- Changed default mode from 'both' to 'backend' for reliable Docker deployment
- Added comprehensive Docker usage instructions and documentation
- Improved startup messaging and user experience
- Enhanced container lifecycle management

üîß Technical Improvements:
- Docker containers no longer exit immediately when using default settings
- Better separation of HTTP API and MCP server modes
- Clear documentation of different deployment modes (backend/mcp/both)
- Enhanced troubleshooting guide and health check endpoints
- Optimized resource usage for containerized deployment

‚úÖ Registry Impact:
- More reliable for end users deploying via Docker
- Better documentation reduces support requests and improves adoption
- Improved stability increases production readiness
- Maintains full MCP protocol compliance
- Enhanced user experience for Docker Desktop integration

üê≥ Docker Improvements:
- Default 'backend' mode ensures containers stay running
- Health check endpoint at /api/health for monitoring
- Persistent data storage with volume mounting
- Production-ready deployment examples (Docker Compose, Kubernetes)
- Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation

üìä Files Updated in Registry Submission:
- server.yaml: Updated image reference, enhanced description, added Docker optimizations
- README.md: Complete documentation with v1.0.1 improvements
- DOCKER-USAGE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt: Comprehensive deployment guide (NEW)
- tools.json: Unchanged (existing MCP tools remain the same)

üéØ Key Benefits for Registry Users:
1. STABILITY: Docker containers now run reliably without manual intervention
2. DOCUMENTATION: Clear setup instructions reduce confusion and support burden
3. PRODUCTION READY: Stable deployment for production use with health monitoring
4. BACKWARD COMPATIBLE: All existing functionality preserved
5. ENHANCED UX: Better startup messages and error handling

The server maintains all existing MCP functionality while providing a significantly
better containerized deployment experience. This addresses the primary pain point
of Docker containers exiting immediately, which was affecting user adoption.

Perfect for users who want reliable task management integration with their AI assistants! üöÄ
