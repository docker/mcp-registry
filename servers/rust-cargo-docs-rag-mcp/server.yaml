  title: Rustdoc Crate Docs RAG
  description: 'This rust crate uses the same rust analyzer lsp libraries so it generates documentation from the code! It is a powerful "must have" for agent driven Rust coding! The server can run in a docker container and will download and format documentation; removing extra content from rustdoc, licensing etc (anything it can figure out that isn''t relevant to the LLM); it can download specific versions of a crate so it makes your cargo.toml OR you can download the latest version.
