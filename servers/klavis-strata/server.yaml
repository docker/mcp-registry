    title: Klavis Strata MCP
    description: Klavis Strata MCP is one MCP server for AI agents to use tools reliably at any scale. It has built in integrations with 80+ applications(e.g. Gmail, Notion, Github, Jira). You can connect to multiple applications in one MCP. With our progressive discovery method, it reduces the context usage of the model and even beats official MCP in terms of task success rate in public benchmark.
