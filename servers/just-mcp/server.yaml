  title: Just Command Runner
  description: "https://just.systems/ provides just, a lightweight command runner using a justfile (like a Makefile) with parameters, macros, and modules. Commands run with just <task>, and an LLM can mount a justfile inside a Docker sandbox to execute them. This is ideal for spec-driven development: agents can memoize tasks like just build, turning the justfile into persistent, version-controlled tribal knowledge. Just also integrates with GitHub Actions, VSCode, and other editors. Using just-mcp reduces context waste because the LLM doesn’t need to read the file—just -l lists available commands—allowing agents to run high-level tasks (build, test, release, commit) and update the justfile when errors occur."
