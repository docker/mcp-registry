  title: TOON - Token-Optimized Object Notation
  description: |
    MCP server for TOON (Token-Optimized Object Notation) conversions. Reduces token
    consumption by up to 60% when working with JSON data in AI contexts.

    TOON compresses JSON data using intelligent abbreviations, schema compression,
    and pattern detection while maintaining full reversibility. Ideal for:
    - Reducing API costs with large JSON payloads
    - Maximizing context window utilization
    - Optimizing AI-assisted data processing workflows
