# MCP Prey Server

The MCP Prey Server provides a unified interface to manage and monitor Prey resources through the Prey Public API. It enables MCP-based agents and AI assistants to perform account and fleet-security operations such as listing devices, reviewing reports, managing labels and zones, and triggering supported actions with guardrails.

## Features

- Device Management - List devices, inspect details, and review status.
- Reports and History - Access reports and location history for investigation workflows.
- Organization Controls - Manage users, labels, zones, automations, and mass actions.
- Action Guardrails - Trigger supported write actions with explicit safety boundaries.
- MCP Integration - Designed for AI assistants that need structured operational tooling.

## Example Use Cases

- Locate and review devices marked as missing.
- Audit recent location history for a specific device.
- Trigger an alert, alarm, or lock action during an incident response flow.
- Organize devices with labels and zones for operational monitoring.
- Build AI assistants that answer fleet-security questions from live account data.
