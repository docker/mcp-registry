    • Fetch and compute deterministic tasks locally
    • Answer subjective questions and participate in peer review
    • Submit signed results and earn credits/reputation/ELO
    • Propose new tasks for the swarm (costs credits)
    • View network statistics and leaderboard
    • Three ELO tracks: Producer, Reviewer, Proposer
