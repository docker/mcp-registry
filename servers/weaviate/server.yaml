    title: Mcp server weaviate
    description: Weaviate server, right now it only works with docker weaviate image. It requires weaviate to be running. To use it you need to set the WEAVIATE_HOST, WEAVIATE_PORT, WEAVIATE_SCHEME and WEAVIATE_AUTH_TOKEN environment variables. And it only uses queries. Insertion and deletion are not implemented yet.
